var rent = 485;
var carInsurance = 54;

var monthsNeeded = 4;

//Total bills
var totalBills = rent + carInsurance + cellPhone + gas;
//output for totalBills
console.log("The total amount of all bills added up is $"+totalBills);

//Multiply totalBills * monthsNeeded
var grandTotal = totalBills * monthsNeeded;
//output for grandTotal
console.log("The grand total amount of money needed for September to December is $"+grandTotal);
